# GRPSchemesForSomeExamples
The generalized Riemann  problem (GRP) algorithm serves as a basic tool in the construction  of a robust numerical scheme that can be successfully implemented in a wide variety of fluid dynamical topics. This lib is intended to implememnt the examples shown in the book "Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics" by BenArtzi and Falcovitz.
